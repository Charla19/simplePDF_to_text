# simplePDF_to_text
A simple project to convert pdf file into text file using smalot/pdfparser with php

Put your pdf file in the /documents folder or change the path to the directory in the index.php file

if there is problem with /vendor directory, you can delete it and run this command : composer require smalot/pdfparser

This isn't working for some version of pdf so i'm working on that
